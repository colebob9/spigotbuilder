# SpigotBuilder

The user-friendly batch script to make a build of Spigot!

**Only works in Windows.**

## Download

[Download the latest release from the releases page.](https://github.com/colebob9/spigotbuilder/releases)

# Features
* Doesn't need an installation of Git to run! (Uses Portable Git)
* Downloads latest BuildTools every run.
* Cleans up files that were generated or downloaded (if wanted).
* Supports any previous version of Spigot to build.
* Downloads everything needed to build, **except Java.**

# Instructions
Simply run `start.bat` to start the building process. It will automatically make a build of Spigot for you. (Do not run any other file.)

**Only run spigotbuilder in its own directory (folder)! If you do not do this, the script may delete something unintentionally! (and may also make a lot of files where you put it as well.)**


# Notes
SpigotBuilder uses [other programs](https://github.com/colebob9/spigotbuilder/wiki/Programs-included-with-releases) to help build. You cannot use the batch file by itself as it is in the source. Please download a [release](https://github.com/colebob9/spigotbuilder/releases) for it to work.

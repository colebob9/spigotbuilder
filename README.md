# spigotbuilder

A simple batch / shell script to make a build of Spigot in the easiest way possible!

Simply run _start.bat_ to start the building process. It will automatically make a build of Spigot for you. (Do not run any other file.)

Features:
* Doesn't need an installation of Git to run!
* Downloads latest BuildTools every run.
* Cleans up files that were generated or downloaded (if wanted).
* Downloads everything needed to build.

Uses wget to download BuildTools and Git. Make sure to include wget in the same directory when building. (easiest way to do this is to download and run a release)

(Tested in Windows 8.1)

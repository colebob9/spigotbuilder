# spigotbuilder

A simple batch / shell script to make a build of Spigot in the easiest way possible! Only works in Windows.

**Only run spigotbuilder in its own directory (folder)! If you do not do this, the script may delete something unintentionally! (and may also make a lot of files where you put it as well.)**

Simply run _start.bat_ to start the building process. It will automatically make a build of Spigot for you. (Do not run any other file.)

Features:
* Doesn't need an installation of Git to run! (Uses Portable Git)
* Downloads latest BuildTools every run.
* Cleans up files that were generated or downloaded (if wanted).
* Downloads everything needed to build.

**Still requires Java 8**

Uses [other programs](https://github.com/colebob9/spigotbuilder/wiki/Programs-included-with-releases) to build. You cannot use the batch file by itself as it is in the source. (If using a [release](https://github.com/colebob9/spigotbuilder/releases), ignore this)

(Tested with Windows 8.1)

# spigotbuilder
A simple batch / shell script to make a build of Spigot!

Simply run _start.bat_ to start the building process. It will guide you through the entire process of making a build.

Uses wget to download BuildTools and Git. Make sure to include wget in the same directory when building. (easiest way to do this is to download and run a release)
